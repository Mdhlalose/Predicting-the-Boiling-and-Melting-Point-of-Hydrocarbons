# Predicting-the-Boiling-and-Melting-Point-of-Hydrocarbons

For predicting boiling points and melting points of certain hydrocarbons, I used the MLPRegressor, which is a Multi-layer Perceptron Regressor, a type of artificial neural network-based regression algorithm. The objective was to use RDKit to create a new dataset containing the atomic weight and the number of aromatic rings of the hydrocarbons. Then, using the new dataset, I created a predictive regression model to estimate boiling points and melting points. I performed various steps to achieve this, including Exploratory Data Analysis, Data Preprocessing, and Modeling, with each step having substeps.
